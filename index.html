<h1>Space Balls: The Movie</h1>
<h4>The cinematic excellence that is the film Space Balls</h4>

<img src="https://mikeladano.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/dark-helmet.jpg">

<h2>The Plot Thickens</h2>
<p>In its essence, the film makes a mockery of the Star Wars: Episode IV-A New Hope. We are introduced to the main characters Lone Starr and Barf, who are the "Han Solo" and "Chewbacca" of the film. They are sent on a mission to save Princess Vespa and the galaxy from the hands of Pizza The Hutt, Dark Helmet and the Downside. Over the course of the movie, they find companions like Dot Matrix, King Roland and best of all, Yogurt, who help them fight and defeat the Downside.</p>

  <h4>Funny Moments and Scenes</h4>

  <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgRFQJCHcPw">May the Schwartz be With You</a></h2>
  <img src="https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/Spaceballs.jpg">
  <p>Let's start off with this scene. After wandering around the desert for a while, the group of Lone Starr, Barf, Princess Vespa, and Dot Matrix stumble across a cave. It is within this cave that they discover the god-like Yogurt. While sharing a name with the snack, Yogurt is a parody of Yoda from Star Wars. Shocked by their discovery, the group praises the stout and goldish man. Less importantly, he introduces the Schwartz, which is the "force". More importanly, he introduces his line of merchandising, or as Yogurt pronounces it, "Moy-chan-die-zing". Yogurt opens the doors and the true fun begins. He Introduces us to Space Balls: The T-Shirt, Space Balls: The coloring Book, Space Balls: The Lunchbox, Space Balls: The Breakfast Cereal and Space Balls: The Flamethrower. According to Yogurt himself, kids love the flamethrower, which is totally meant for kids. Oh, and we can't forget. Space Balls: The Doll. The doll is Yogurt himself. May the Schwartz be with you.</p>

  <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGvblGCD7qM">We've Been Jammed</a></h2>
  <p>Let's take a trip onto our favorite space ship. In this scene, we will explore what it truly means for the satellite to get "jammed". Lone Starr and Barf are cruising the galaxy in Eagle 5 in attempts to find Princess Vespa. Their ship, which is meant to be a play on Luke Skywalker's "Red 5", stumbles upon Spaceball I, who has Princess Vespa's ship in its tractor beam. To release her from Dark Helmet's grasp, Barf "jams" the satellite of Spaceball I, with raspberry jam. While this context is important, it is what follows that is more important. The Radar Operator, who is the famous human sound board also known as Michael Winslow, notices a disturbance in the radar. He calls for Dark Helmet and Colonel Sandurz to come over and famously makes Dark Helmet crash out by making his voice sound like a radio. Once he finishes crashing out, the technician begins to tell them what he has lost. The bleeps, the sweeps and the creeps, each one sounded out by Winslow. The real kicker though is when the jam comes through the screen and Dark Helmet tastes the jam. He famously states that Lone Starr would be only one bold enough to raspberry jam him *pause*. He flips his helmet sheild down and a cinematic zoom shot commences, ending with Helmet getting decked by the camera. He got jammed!</p>

  <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAWL8ejf2nM">They've Gone to Plaid</a></h2>
  <img src="https://pm1.aminoapps.com/6145/8020b1710924442465a4c53e7b282ba72a4120aa_hq.jpg">
  <p>Next on the docket is when Lone Starr and Barf are trying to escape the reins of Dark Helmet and the Downside's control. While gearing up to attack Lone Starr's ship, Eagle 5 takes off into the galaxy, stumping both Dark Helmet and Colonel Sandurz. The colonel suggests the crew to brace for "Light Speed", however Dark Helmet interjects, saying they need to go to "Ludicrous Speed". Everyone is shocked by this statement, but Helmet is standing on business. Colonel Sandurz questions him again, but Dark Helmet calls him a chicken. After a shitty first try, the colonel gets on the PA and annouces for the ship to prepare for "Ludicrous Speed". Dark Helmet says go, and they are off. They travel so fast that all Dark Helmet can do is hold on for dear life, for he is literally clinging to a railing looking like Superman. However, Space Ball One travels so fast that they go <strong>plaid</strong>. They pass over Eagle 5, and Barf famously says, "They've gone plaid". Noticing that that they passed them, Dark Helmet urges them to stop, despite their ludicrous speed. When Colonel Sandurz pulls the lever, Dark Helmet flies forward head first into the front console of the ship. Both the colonel and others check on him. He ask if they are stopped then delivers the greatest timed line of all time. "Smoke 'em if you got 'em".</p>

  <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD5eqBDPMDg">We Ain't Found Shit</a></h2> 
  <p>While a rather shorter scene, the "Comb the Desert" scene is still one of great comedy. It starts by President Skroog being woken up by the message that the princess had been lost in the Sands of Vega. As he learns this, he requests his crew to comb the desert. However, Dark Helmet took these commands a little too literally. He had his men use giant combs in the sand to "comb the desert" for the princess. Dark Helmet asks his men what they have found. The first two groups responds quickly, saying nothing has been found. The third group has a different answer, with the trooper saying, "We ain't found shit".</p>

  <h2>Reviews and Recommendations</h2>
  While our journey through the galaxy is almost over, I thought it may be good to give just a little bit more to hold onto to sway you to watch the grail that is Space Balls. If you want a movie that bridges the gap between comedy and Star Wars: Episode IV- A New Hope, this is the movie for you. Still action packed, many jokes are cracked that bring a laugh to all who view the movie. Many quotable lines float throughout the movie and a story lline thick with meaning exists among a light-hearted jab of its space movie counterpart. If you need any more persuasion, here are three reviews.
